    <h3>Profile</h3>
    <p id="bio">I am a driven and industrious individual
      with an ambition to further myself in
      the operations sector of banking and
      finance. I have a great willingness to
      learn and become a highly adaptable
      person. I constantly strive to become
      the most resourceful individual I can be.
      I am a dependable individual that has a
      real desire to work in a challenging work
      environment that’ll take advantage of my
      ability to solve complex problems<p>
    <br>
      I excel both within a team setting, and as a
      reliable individual when resolving complex
      problems and workloads in a professional
      capacity. I have a deep interest in the
      structures of financial markets, global
      economies, and corporate entities and
      their impact on how our lives function,
      both economically and socially. It’s this
      relevancy as to how our world functions
      which has driven me to this sector and the
      desire to grow within the banking industry.<p>
